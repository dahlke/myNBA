IDEAS:
    - Top 10 rivalries / teams that have played each other the most times
    - Of them, who has the biggest point differential?
    - Over time how did those point differentials cross over as one team got better?
    - Teams with the biggest point differentials against each other
    - Teams with the biggest point differentials at home or away against each other
    - Players with the biggest point differentials against each other
